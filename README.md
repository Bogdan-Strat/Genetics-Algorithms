# Genetics-Algorithms
This is a course project in which I implemented genetics algorithms which was presented to me at Advanced Algorithms course

The data.txt file represents the input file and the field from it means: 

            dimension of population

            interval [a,b] where the function is defined

            the function -x^2+x+2 (in my case)

            precision of the numbers from generation(how much decimal are after comma)

            probability of making crossingover

            probability for one gene to suffer mutations

            number of steps until the algorithm must stop

THe output.txt file is the output file and represents how the should be displayed
